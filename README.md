# 3D Path Guide Application using 3D Reconstruction
This application provides 3D Inha University Building 5 to users so that anyone can intuitively grasp the internal structure of the building.
Then the path is visualized by navigating the optimal path in the 3D space, making it easy for users to find their way.
In addition, we have implemented a tour mode that you can freely explore the building.
